# Portfolio

## UW CODING BOOT CAMP HOMEWORK 02

## Summary
Here you will find my current portfolio as a web developer. All of which will contain past, current, and future projects that I have built and will be building since I started UW Coding Bootcamp in September 2020.

Current projects are still a work in progress. Thus most/all images you will see are acting as my placeholders.

This project will serve as the Portfolio I will be using for future job prospects, which will continuosly be edited, updated, and improved on as I continue to build on my coding skills through this program.
