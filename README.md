# Portfolio

## UW CODING BOOT CAMP HOMEWORK 02

## Summary
Here you will find my current portfolio as a web developer. All of which will contain past, current, and future projects that I have built and will be building since I started UW Coding Bootcamp in September 2020.

Current projects are still a work in progress. Thus most/all images you will see are acting as my placeholders.

This project will serve as the Portfolio I will be using for future job prospects, which will continuosly be edited, updated, and improved on as I continue to build on my coding skills through this program.

## Content and Description: CSS and HTML
Here is my thought process for building this website:
First container, I set as -
* Container A: Header
    - And then I've included the following within this container -
    1. Background
        * Main image background
        * Background color
        * Font-Family
    1. Links
        * href tags
        * Alignment is fixed at the top-right of the page
        * Links directly to the id tags on the body section
        * Evenly spaced for readability
    1. Name
        * Set at a certain font-size
        * Alignment is fixed at the top-left of the page
        * Background and font color opposite that of Links
    1. Title
        * Same background and font color as Name
        * Alignment is fixed on the bottom-right of the header
        * Padding
    1. Self-Portrait
        * Styling different from a regular square block

Second container, I set as -
* Container B: Body
    - And then I've set 3 sub-containers to style easily -
    1. About Me
        * Descriptive paragraph
    1. Work
        * 5 Images (with a featured project larger than the other 4 images)
        * Subtitles (sits on top of each image)
        * Hover (opacity changes when mouse hovers on each image)
    1. Contact Me
        * Links
